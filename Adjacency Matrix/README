This program is written to take a representation of a network graph, as
described as follows, to print an adjacency matrix.

The network graph should be represented as a spaced list of integers, denoting
the 'name' of each vertex (classically this would be 0 to n-1, where n is the
number of vertices).
Every line following the first will be understood as a reference to the 'name'
of the vertex being the first integer, and every following integer in the line
represents the next vertex between which an 'edge' is located.

The output will be an n-by-n matrix of 1s and 0s, where each value denotes the
existence (1) or lack of (0) an edge at the intersection of the vertices 'named'
by their position in this matrix.
